# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
### A tic-tac-toe game project built on Python 3.0!

The Project: Create a Tic Tac Toe game. You are free to use any IDE you like.

Here are the requirements:
1. Two players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer). 
2. The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move. 
3. You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board.

Happy Coding!
